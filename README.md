# 🌌 Night Simulator

**Night Simulator** is a Unity 3D game project developed as part of a college submission. Set in a mysterious, neon-lit city at night, the game features two unique modes: a **Survival Challenge** where you must collect 8 pages while evading *Slenderman*, and a **Free Roam Driving Mode** where you can relax and explore the dark city streets at your own pace.

Built using **Unity 2022.3 LTS**, the game combines eerie atmosphere, smooth vehicle mechanics, and immersive lighting to deliver both thrill and freedom in one experience.
